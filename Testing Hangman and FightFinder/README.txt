In the EvilHangMan java file, there are certain branches that are unreachable by the test cases. For example, line 88: Òif (wordlist[i].charAt(j) != ch) {Ò the case when the conditional is false is not possible because the EvilHangMan is not expected to lose. Thus, the other branch is never reached. Evil Hangman never loses. Similarly on line 106: Òif (wordlist[i].charAt(j) != ch) {Ò. The case when the conditional is not true is never reached. Hence one branch is missed out.
